# Three.js with Vite Starter

This is a starter project for building 3D applications in the browser using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It provides a fast, modern development environment with minimal configuration.

## Key Concepts

- **Three.js**: A JavaScript 3D graphics library that simplifies WebGL. It lets you create and render 3D scenes, objects, lighting, and camera views with ease.

- **Vite**: A modern frontend build tool that provides fast startup and instant hot module replacement during development.

- **ES Modules**: The project uses modern JavaScript syntax with `import`/`export` for modular, maintainable code.
